Private error code lookup online.

ec.skylined.nl allows you to input an error code and outputs a list of possible meanings from a list of known Windows error codes (HRESULT, Win32, NTSTATUS). The errorcodes are translated locally and not sent to a server: all error code lookups are 100% confidential.

You can type an error code in the input window, or open the page from a link with the errorcode after the hash sign (#).

Feel free to make a pull request to add additional error codes if you know any that are currently missing.
